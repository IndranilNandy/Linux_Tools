For any custom setup, create a directroy 'customsetup' (say) under Custom_setup_definitions.
Create two files under that directory with names '.customsetup' and '.customsetup-aptpkgtools'

.customsetup -> contains all the packages to be excluded from installation, separated by |
.customsetup-aptpkgtools -> contains all packages to be installed by apt

Sample run command, of root .setup file would be like this-
./.setup --type=dev --log-target=file --custom-setup=server-minimal

Available options for command line parameters:
    type:           min|default|dev|full
    log-target:     file|term
    custom-setup:   server-minimal
