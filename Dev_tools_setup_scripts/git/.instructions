Entrypoint directory: 
    All scripts under this directory and sub-directories should be run from this directory. All the script-paths are relative to this directory.
    To use these scripts in any other bash script do a 'cd' to this directory first in a sub-shell, e.g., (cd root_dir && ./xyz.sh)

Entry script:
    ./.setup: call this for full installation
    ./git_installer.sh: complete installation script

Installers:
    ./git_installer.sh: installs and configures git + gcm
    ./gcm_installer.sh: installs and configures gcm only

Uninstallers:
    ./git_uninstaller.sh: uninstalls git + gcm
    ./gcm_uninstaller.sh: uninstalls gcm only

Configurers:
    ./configurer/git_configurer.sh: configures git only
    ./configurer/gcm_configurer.sh: configures gcm only

How to use?
1. setgittool:
    Available from /usr/local/bin/mycommands as a global command.
    Use: setgittool <toolname>, e.g., setgittool meld
    Tools list: .tools lists all the tools currently available. If you install new tool update this list. Default is always 'winmerge'. You can change the 'selected' one using setgitool.
    Merge and Diff commands: .toolcommands lists the merge and diff commands corresponding to the tool. Whenever you add a new tool in .tools, add corresponding merge and diff commands in this file.
