Entrypoint directory: 
    All scripts under this directory and sub-directories should be run from this directory. All the script-paths are relative to this directory.
    To use these scripts in any other bash script do a 'cd' to this directory first in a sub-shell, e.g., (cd root_dir && ./xyz.sh)
