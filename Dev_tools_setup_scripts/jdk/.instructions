    All scripts under this directory and sub-directories should be run from this directory. All the script-paths are relative to this directory.
    To use these scripts in any other bash script do a 'cd' to this directory first in a sub-shell, e.g., (cd root_dir && ./xyz.sh)

    ./jdk_installer.sh: complete installation script

    ./jdk_installer.sh: installs and configures java

Uninstallers:
    ./jdk_uninstaller.sh: uninstalls java
