Entrypoint directory: 
    All scripts under this directory and sub-directories should be run from this directory. All the script-paths are relative to this directory.
    To use these scripts in any other bash script do a 'cd' to this directory first in a sub-shell, e.g., (cd root_dir && ./xyz.sh)

Entry script:
    ./.initCluster: call this for full cluster setup (including all components installation if missing). This does a setup on control plane, worker nodes and client nodes
    ./tearCluster: tear down the cluster
    ./initClusterClients: call this to do setup only on client nodes to access the cluster control node. If you've called ./.initCluster then automatically client nodes are configured.

How to use?
1. ./.initCluster:
    MANDATORY command parameters -
    Either use --configdir or both --clusterconfig and --machineconfig.

    ./.initCluster --configdir=[ClusterConfigFolder]
    ClusterConfigFolder directory must be created in ./config/userdefined, and it should contain files named .clusterconfig and .machineconfig
    If ClusterConfigFolder isn't provided, then the defaults would be taken. Default configuration is in ./config/defaults
    e.g. ./.initCluster --configdir=Cluster_1

    Alternatively, you can run as - 
    ./.initCluster --clusterconfig=[clusterconfigFile] --machineconfig=[machineconfigFile]
    Both clusterconfigFile and machineconfigFile should have full absolute path mentioned.
    e.g. ./.initCluster --clusterconfig=$HOME/MyConfigs/clusterConf1 --machineconfig=$HOME/MyConfigs/machineConf1

    Other OPTIONAL command parameters available -
        --promptpassword/--filepassword
            promptpassword:
                - promptpassword is DEFAULT option. It'll ask for each node's login credentials and 'sudo' credentials on command prompt.
            filepassword:
                - filepassword takes the credentials stored in files acting as credentials store. As you passwords will be stored unencrypted in a file, 
                take caution while using this.
                - This can be used either with --configdir or both --clusterconfig and --machineconfig. In both case, if .credconfig file isn't already available,
                it copies .machineconfig to its own directory as .clusterconfig and opens it in your default editor where you can provide the credentials for individual
                machines/nodes. While running the scripts, it will use these credentials and will never prompt for any.
                - A default template is provided in ./config/defaults/.credconfigtemplate. You may use it as a template for your cluster. DO NOT forget to put it in
                correct location. In any case, if you don't provide any, on first run, it will create one as mentioned in the previous point.
        --allnodes
            - Will not provide YES/NO prompt for each individual node before the setup script proceeds. It'll take YES as a response, by default.
            - this option is mainly useful for tearCluster command.
        --help
            - Shows help contents.

2. ./.tearCluster:
    MANDATORY command parameters -
    Either use --configdir or both --clusterconfig and --machineconfig.

    ./.tearCluster --configdir=[ClusterConfigFolder]
    ClusterConfigFolder directory must be created in ./config/userdefined, and it should contain files named .clusterconfig and .machineconfig
    If ClusterConfigFolder isn't provided, then the defaults would be taken. Default configuration is in ./config/defaults
    e.g. ./.tearcluster --configdir=Cluster_1

    Alternatively, you can run as - 
    ./.tearCluster --clusterconfig=[clusterconfigFile] --machineconfig=[machineconfigFile]
    Both clusterconfigFile and machineconfigFile should have full absolute path mentioned.
    e.g. ./.tearcluster --clusterconfig=$HOME/MyConfigs/clusterConf1 --machineconfig=$HOME/MyConfigs/machineConf1

    Other OPTIONAL command parameters available -
        --promptpassword/--filepassword
            promptpassword:
                - promptpassword is DEFAULT option. It'll ask for each node's login credentials and 'sudo' credentials on command prompt.
            filepassword:

                take caution while using this.
                - This can be used either with --configdir or both --clusterconfig and --machineconfig. In both case, if .credconfig file isn't already available,
                it copies .machineconfig to its own directory as .clusterconfig and opens it in your default editor where you can provide the credentials for individual
                machines/nodes. While running the scripts, it will use these credentials and will never prompt for any.
                - A default template is provided in ./config/defaults/.credconfigtemplate. You may use it as a template for your cluster. DO NOT forget to put it in
                correct location. In any case, if you don't provide any, on first run, it will create one as mentioned in the previous point.
        --allnodes

            - this option is mainly useful for tearCluster command.

3. ./.initClusterClients:
    MANDATORY command parameters -
    Either use --configdir or both --clusterconfig and --machineconfig.

    ./.initClusterClients --configdir=[ClusterConfigFolder]
    ClusterConfigFolder directory must be created in ./config/userdefined, and it should contain files named .clusterconfig and .machineconfig
    If ClusterConfigFolder isn't provided, then the defaults would be taken. Default configuration is in ./config/defaults
    e.g. ./.initClusterClients --configdir=Cluster_1

    ./.initClusterClients --clusterconfig=[clusterconfigFile] --machineconfig=[machineconfigFile]
    Both clusterconfigFile and machineconfigFile should have full absolute path mentioned.
