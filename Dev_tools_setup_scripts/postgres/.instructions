Entrypoint directory:
    All scripts under this directory and sub-directories should be run from this directory. All the script-paths are relative to this directory.
    To use these scripts in any other bash script do a 'cd' to this directory first in a sub-shell, e.g., (cd root_dir && ./xyz.sh)

Entry script:
    ./.setup: call this for full installation

Installers:
    ./postgres_installer.sh: complete installation script

Uninstallers:
    ./postgres_uninstaller.sh: uninstalls postgres and other components
