Entrypoint directory: 
    All scripts under this directory and sub-directories should be run from this directory. All the script-paths are relative to this directory.
    To use these scripts in any other bash script do a 'cd' to this directory first in a sub-shell, e.g., (cd root_dir && ./xyz.sh)

Entry script:
    ./.setup: call this for full installation
    ./nfs_setup.sh: complete installation script for both server and client

Installers:
    ./nfs_setup.sh: installs and configures NFS for both server and client

Uninstallers:
    ./server/nfs_serverside_uninstaller.sh: uninstalls NFS from server
    ./client/nfs_clientside_uninstaller.sh: uninstalls NFS from client
