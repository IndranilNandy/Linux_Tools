Entrypoint directory: 
    All scripts under this directory and sub-directories should be run from this directory. All the script-paths are relative to this directory.
    To use these scripts in any other bash script do a 'cd' to this directory first in a sub-shell, e.g., (cd root_dir && ./xyz.sh)

Entry script:
    ./.setup: call this for full setup

Commands:
    .commands: lists all exported commands.

How to use?
1. tracelink:
    Available from /usr/local/bin/mycommands as a custom command.
    Usage:  
            (1) tracelink <linkname>, e.g., tracelink setgittool
            If <linkname> is a valid link name(absolute/relative), it'll return the original source path of that link.
            If <linkname> is any path (valid/invalid) to a file/directory, it'll return the same path.
            Otherwise it'll show error.
            Use this within a bash script to find the source path of that script, if that script is referred to by a symbolic link. Use as "tracelink ${0}" or "tracelink ${SOURCE_BASH}"
