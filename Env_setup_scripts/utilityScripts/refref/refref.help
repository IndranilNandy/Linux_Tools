Description:
    [ Reference to script references ]
    
    $HOME/.myconfig/.configloader/.reflaoder    - contains all the script references to various Linux_Tools setup scripts. These are one-liners executing those referred scripts in corresponding script-directories.
    /usr/local/bin/myscriptrefs                 - contains all the symlinks to the script references in the aforementioned directory (.reflaoder).
    .refconfig                                  - list of original script commands for which refs to be created.
                                                  [Format] <script-command> <absolue path of script-location>

    1. Update myscriptrefs with symlinks to newly created script refs in refloader.
    2. Update refloader with new script refs corresponding to new script-command entries in .refconfig

How to add a new entry?
    Option 1:
    This would save the entry in .refconfig to be used in any other system setup.
    1. Run 'refref --config' -> add new entry
    2. Run 'refref --sync' -> this adds ref in refloader and symlink in myscriptrefs
    3. Run 'myalias --config' -> run this to add a myalias if you may want
    4. Run 'mycompl --config' or 'mycompl <tab_completion_logic>' to add tab-completion

    Option 2:
    This would directly add script ref to refloader, on entry is saved in .refconfig. This mainly to be used in any script which is always run as part of the system setup.
    1. Run 'refref --create' -> add script ref to refloader.
    2. This will automatically call 'refref --sym' to create symlinks. So no need to run any other command manually.
    3. Run 'myalias --config' -> run this to add a myalias if you may want
    4. Run 'mycompl --config' or 'mycompl <tab_completion_logic>' to add tab-completion

Usage:
    refref --create
        Add new script refs to refloader directly. 
        NOTE: it doesn't keep any entry in .refconfig (i.e., is NOT saved to be used in any other setup), and this is the difference with --config option.
        Hence, it is not advised to run it manually. Though, this can be used in any other script (to make it available like default commands), which will always run as part of a system setup script, so that the refs are automatically added to the refloader in any fresh setup.
    refref --sym
        Update myscriptrefs with symlinks to newly created script refs in refloader.
        NOTE: Not needed for end user generally. Used in scripts. You would use 'refref --sync' after adding any script ref.
    refref --ref
        Update refloader with new script refs corresponding to new script-command entries in .refconfig
        NOTE: Not needed for end user generally. Used in scripts. You would use 'refref --sync' after adding any script ref.
    refref --sync
        Equivalent to first running 'refref --ref' (update all the script refs) followed by 'refref --sym' (update all symlinks in myscriptrefs)
    refref --config
        Add new entry to .refconfig to create new script refs for any script-command.
        NOTE: This always ensures that the entry is saved in the .refconfig for future system setups, and this is the diffrence with --create option.
        Hence, for random/arbitrary script refs, it is always advised to first save it in .refconfig, using 'refref --config' first. After this, run 'refref --sync'
