                    # Causes a rollover once the date/time pattern no longer applies to the active file
                    TimeBasedTriggeringPolicy:
                        interval: 60		# [Default: 1] How often a rollover should occur based on the most specific time unit in the date pattern.
                        modulate: false		# [Default: false] Indicates whether the interval should be adjusted to cause the next rollover to occur on the interval boundary.
                        maxRandomDelay: 0   # [Default: 0] Indicates the maximum number of seconds to randomly delay a rollover.
                    # Causes a rollover once the file has reached the specified size.
                    SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy:
                        size: 4096 KB		# The size can be specified in bytes, with the suffix KB, MB, GB, or TB, for example 20MB. The size may also contain a fractional value such as 1.5 MB. When combined with a time based triggering policy the file pattern must contain a %i otherwise the target file will be overwritten on every rollover as the SizeBased Triggering Policy will not cause the timestamp value in the file name to change.

                # The default rollover strategy accepts both a date/time pattern and an integer from the filePattern attribute specified on the RollingFileAppender itself. If the date/time pattern is present it will be replaced with the current date and time values. If the pattern contains an integer it will be incremented on each rollover. If the pattern contains both a date/time and integer in the pattern the integer will be incremented until the result of the date/time pattern changes.
                DefaultRolloverStrategy:
                    max: 20				# [Default: 7] The maximum value of the counter. Once this values is reached older archives will be deleted on subsequent rollovers.
                    min: 1				# [Default: 1] The minimum value of the counter.
                    fileIndex: max	# [Default: max] [max/min/nomax] If set to "max" (the default), files with a higher index will be newer than files with a smaller index. If set to "min", file renaming and the counter will follow the Fixed Window strategy described above. Finally, as of release 2.8, if the fileIndex attribute is set to "nomax" then the min and max values will be ignored and file numbering will increment by 1 and each rollover will have an incrementally higher value with no maximum number of files.
