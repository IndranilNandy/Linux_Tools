Description:
    Customized installer to install/uninstall all/specific APT/SNAP packages (listed in .localAptPkgTools/.fullAptPkgTools/.localSnapPkgTools/fullSnapPkgTools).
    .localAptPkgTools/.localSnapPkgTools: 
        - Lists all the APT/SNAP packages installed (with myinstaller only) in the current setup/system only. 
        - Every new installation of package using minstaller tool will add that package in this list, and uninstallation removes it from this list. 
        - Hence, this list shows the current snapshot of the system.
        - '--uninstall --FULL' uses this list.
    .fullAptPkgTools/fullSnapPkgTools:
        - Lists superset of any APT/SNAP packages installed across system and time.
        - Any uninstallation doesn't remove any entry from this list.
        - Installation of any new APT package anytime in any system adds new entry in this list, if that was missing.
        - '--install --FULL' option uses this list, and copies each entry to .localAptPkgTools if missing.

Usage:
    myinstaller --install --FULL
    myinstaller --install --LOCAL <tempList_fullFilePath>
    myinstaller --install <toolname>
    myinstaller --uninstall --FULL
    myinstaller --uninstall --LOCAL <tempList_fullFilePath>
    myinstaller --uninstall <toolname>
    myinstaller --list
    myinstaller --help
    myinstaller
